philosophy
==========

This repository details my philosophy and personal style guide for various 
pursuits, including, but not limited to, coding and translation.

Although I think it would be great if you chose to follow the same philosophy,
nothing in this repository is meant to be prescriptive. It's really just for my
personal use and for the information of others.
